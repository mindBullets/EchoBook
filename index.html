          <h2>APPROACHING SHATTER</h2>
          <p>In the late 21st century, humanity left Earth due to multiple resource shortcomings aggravated by an acceleration in climate change. They settled Echo, a planet that was nearly a carbon copy of Earth except for being devoid of all but the most basic life forms. Fast forward 1200 years later. Echo has endured over a thousand years of dark age. Corporations and government merged early on, becoming the oppressive authority known as the Regime. Military and police merged into the Department of Enforcement, their only mission to crush the huge network of rebels known as the Dissidents. Over half the planet is covered by decaying cityscapes and the elite live high above, removed and remote from the greater populace on the moon-city of Ascension. Hope lies in one man, a former Enforcer named Atriya. But before he can break the cycle of darkness and ignorance on Echo, he has to do it within himself.</p>

          <p>Most of us change gradually-over the course of decades. For Crusader Atriya, it will happen in a single, agonizing day. On the edge of a decaying cityscape, Atriya struggles to hold onto his identity as he faces death from both enemies and allies alike. In the process, his old self is torn away, and he catches a glimpse of what he may one day become.</p>

              This is one of the few times in my life where I'm searching for words. Fantastic, amazing, glorious...they don't really do it justice or provide any real depth. This book is rather indescribable. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I also didn't intend to lose sleep before work to finish it, but I did and am seriously contemplating losing more sleep by reading the next one. However, I won't, because this story needs savored. It is not a convenient glass of wine to be downed and followed by another, but one that should be appreciated, ruminated over, before even taking another sip.

              Edge of your seat reading. I don't usually look for stories involving war, violence, despair, but the character Atriya caught me in Volume 1, so I had to see what would happen with him in Volume 2. I couldn't put it down. There is definitely war, violence, and despair, but the exceptional imagery paired with Atriya's introspection and evaluation of his surroundings, his interactions with other characters, make for a superb reading experience. I want to stand behind Kent Wayne and say "Write Faster" so we can see what happens in Volume 3.      </blockquote>

            <p>Hello everybody, my name is Kent Wayne.  I’ve started getting requests for more personal info so I thought I’d put up this author page.  I know it is commonly practiced social media etiquette to have lots of pictures and access to personal life available, but I tend to veer the other way.  I like my privacy.  Sorry if that offends you.  I’m not trying to be rude.</p>
            <p>I spent around ten years in the military.  I was never a sex-nuts strong, roided-out Bin-laden-wasting-stud, nor was I a fat, whiny, high-and-tight (it’s the stereotypical military haircut) wearing pencil-pusher that lived to yell at people about uniform and haircut regulations because he was bullied in high school and couldn’t get a date (sorry about the bluntness, that’s the military for you).  Within those two extremes, I fall somewhere in between.  I’m not going to get specific about units or what branch I was in.  That was a different person, and it doesn’t matter now anyways.  I’m out and done with that stuff.  While it definitely informs my writing, the chapter has closed on that part of my life.</p>
            <p>I prefer not to be thanked for my service.  Plenty of great articles out there that can express why better than I ever could.</p>
            <p>My view on the military, just to try and give you some insight on my perspective (without waxing overly long):  The military is a reflection of society.  Of humanity.  Within it, you can find behavior that is villainous, heroic, idiotic, and genius.  The full spectrum.  And just like life, one person can exhibit some of each.  That’s pretty much always the case, too.  Nobody is a badass 100% of the time.  Nobody is a piece of shit 100% of the time.  I find most portrayals of the military reductive in that it doesn’t recognize this basic fact:  The military is made up of humans, and they are subject to human nature.  When it becomes clear that shitbags can become amazing and heroes can become convicted of child molestation and end up as scum, then the folly of using a label to reduce somebody to hero, baby-killer, badass, or brainwashed becomes shortsighted and childish.</p>
            <p>This is everywhere, not just the military.  I’m resigned to the idea that humans love to turn something into an easy-to-get-riled about, simplistic point of view.  But I have seen it get better as I get older, so I have hope.  I think the internet and the increased ease of sharing information has a lot to do with it.
            The great lesson I learned from the military:  Ideals are nice and soul-stirring, but people tend to get blinded by them.  It is the ability to perceive the minutely relevant changes instance to instance, circumstance to circumstance, that will carry you.  It is not comfortably reductive idealism, but all-inclusory awareness that will let you navigate not just life, but all of existence.</p>
            <p>(Hops off the soapbox)  I know that’s a poor bio, but I hope that through my obnoxiously grandiose statement you will find out more about me than if I were to list a chronological series of life events.  And I hope it wasn’t too pretentiously poetic.  As a character from one of my favorite authors said about a bunch of mentally masturbatory goth vampire wannabes:  “Too much time on their hands.  Leads to poetry.”  (Just kidding.  I love poetry.  Some of it.  Maybe.)</p>
            <p>Thanks for checking out my works!  To all you writers, I wish you inspired drafting and insightful editing!</p>
            <p>Kent Wayne</p>
